## DriverPass is a company that aims to provide driving lessons, online classes and practice tests, and on-the road training to help those preparing for a driving test at the DMV. The purpose is to address the high failure rate for the DMV driving test. The DriverPass project is a web-based system that provides various functionalities such as online learning, driving lesson scheduling, package customization, and customer service. What I believe I did particularly well on is the Gantt chart outlining the schedule of tasks for the project. To interpret user's needs, you can gather requirements and objectives for the project to ensure functional and non-functional requirements are met. It is important to consider the userâ€™s needs to ensure that the final product is marketable and can thrive in competition with other competitors. It is also important to ensure the final product is user-centric and can be easily navigated with a clear interface.
